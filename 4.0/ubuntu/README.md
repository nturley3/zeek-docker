# Ubuntu Build
This Docker build is for Zeek development (such as Zeek scripts). It is not set up to be a multi-stage build and produces a fairly large image. 

It is also not intended to be used to run Zeek in a production capacity. Use the Alpine Docker build if you would like to run Zeek in your environment for network traffic collection.
